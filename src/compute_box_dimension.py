def compute_box_dimension(lattice):
    """ Compute the box-dimension of a binary lattice where 0s represent empty
        sites, and 1s occupied sites
        Since we apply np.roll, which is currently not (fully!) supported by Numba,
        we cannot (yet) use Numba to (i) call this function from Numba code or 
        (ii) potentially speed up the computation. It is most likely best to call
        this script from native Python code.
